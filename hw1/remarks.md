### Observations:
- Sigma2 controls the shape of the distribution of x_hat.
- y2 (mean) controls where the distrbution is centered at.
- Better the precision in the measurement of y2 makes x_hat "closer/ similar" to the distribution of y2.
- When sigma2 tends towards 0; x_hat distribution tends towards distrbution of y2.
